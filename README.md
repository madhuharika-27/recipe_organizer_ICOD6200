Task Description:
This Task is assigned to Konga Madhu Harika during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program is to create a RECIPE ORGANIZER web application using html,css and javascript.

Implementation and Code Explaination:
1. **HTML Structure**:
   - The HTML document defines the structure of the Recipe Organizer application. 
   - The `<header>` section contains the application title, "Recipe Organizer", styled with a background color, white text, and centered alignment.
   - The `<main>` section is divided into two sections: `#recipe-list` and `#recipe-details`.
   - `#recipe-list` displays the list of available recipes, while `#recipe-details` shows details of the selected recipe.
   - Inside `#recipe-list`, an unordered list (`<ul>`) with an id of `#recipes` is defined. Each recipe will be represented as a list item (`<li>`) within this list.
   - Inside `#recipe-details`, the initial content is set to "Select a recipe to view details."

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - CSS is used to style various elements of the application for a visually appealing and consistent layout.
   - The `body` rule sets a font family, margin, padding, and background color to create a clean and readable interface.
   - The header is styled with a dark background color, white text, centered alignment, and padding to enhance visibility.
   - `#recipe-list` and `#recipe-details` sections have a white background, rounded corners, padding, and flexbox layout (`display: flex`) to organize content.
   - List items (`<li>`) in the recipe list (`#recipe-list`) are styled to have a cursor pointer, margin, padding, rounded corners, and a hover effect to improve user interaction.

3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - JavaScript dynamically populates the recipe list and displays recipe details upon user interaction.
   - The `DOMContentLoaded` event listener ensures that the script executes after the HTML content is fully loaded.
   - An array named `recipes` contains objects representing different recipes, each with properties like name, ingredients, and image URL.
   - The `forEach` loop iterates over the `recipes` array to generate a list item for each recipe. Event listeners are attached to each list item to trigger the `displayRecipeDetails`          function when clicked.
   - The `displayRecipeDetails` function takes a recipe object as input and dynamically generates HTML content to display the recipe details, including the name, image, and list of             ingredients.
   - The ingredients are displayed as an unordered list (`<ul>`) inside the recipe details section (`#recipe-details-content`), enhancing readability and organization.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Recipe Organizer application offers a comprehensive solution for managing and exploring recipes. Through a well-structured HTML layout, visually appealing CSS styling, and interactive JavaScript functionality, users can easily browse through a list of recipes and view detailed information about each one. The application's simplicity and intuitive design make it accessible to users of all levels, whether they are looking for specific recipes or simply browsing for inspiration. By leveraging the power of web technologies, the Recipe Organizer demonstrates the potential of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating practical and user-centric applications. Overall, this project highlights the importance of combining functionality with aesthetics to deliver a seamless and enjoyable user experience in recipe management.
