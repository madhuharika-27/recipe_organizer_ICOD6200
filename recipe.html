Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of oil. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken pieces and stir-fry until they are cooked through and no longer pink in the center. Remove the chicken from the wok and set it aside. In the same wok, add a bit more oil if needed and toss in the chopped vegetables. Stir-fry the vegetables until they are crisp-tender, maintaining their vibrant colors. Return the cooked chicken to the wok and toss everything together.

In a separate large skillet or pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and minced garlic, sautéing until they become translucent and fragrant.

Deglaze the pan with a splash of white wine, stirring until the liquid is absorbed. Begin adding the warm broth to the rice mixture, one ladleful at a time, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and tender but still slightly firm to the bite, which usually takes about 18-20 minutes. In the meantime, sauté sliced mushrooms in a separate skillet until they are golden brown and tender. Once the risotto reaches the desired consistency, stir in the cooked mushrooms along with grated Parmesan cheese, chopped fresh parsley, and a knob of butter to enhance the creaminess.
